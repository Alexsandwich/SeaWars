# SeaWars
Sea wars is a gamemode thought of by Pavel (DrunkCactus), based off a garry's mod gamemode which we do not remember the name of. The main premise behind the game is there are teams which players can choose to join. Once the game starts, they are teleported to an area where they can obtain blocks to build a boat. Once the boat building period is over, there will be water which rises to a certain level. Then people will attack the other boats. Each block holds a certain amount of health. Once the ship loses a certain % of its block, they sink and the team is eliminated. Last man standing wins.
